# FactoryMethodPattern
From Christopher Ohkravi's great series on Head First Design Patterns https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCbF-4yQQAWw-UnuCd2Azfzg

I did this to play with factory method pattern which I kind of already knew.

The factory here is the UnitOfWork factory which gives you a unit of work with the proper connection/context.
