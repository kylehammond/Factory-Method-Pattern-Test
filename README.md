# FactoryMethodPattern
From Christopher Ohkravi's great series on Head First Design Patterns https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCbF-4yQQAWw-UnuCd2Azfzg

I did this to play with factory method pattern which I knew in a less official way.

I've created a factory here to give you the UnitOfWork factory which gives you an instance with the proper connection/context.
